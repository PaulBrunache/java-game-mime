- I designed this game using the tictactoe game as an example
- to test this program just run BlobsDemo.java
- for the random vs random agent, I have each one randomly select the next move
- for the random vs minimax with cutoff, one is choosing randomly while the other
	using minimax search
- the for evaluation function, I used the number of colors that are currently present on the board
****NOTE *****
- when I run each of the tests 2 Times, because the output might over flow since there is a large amount of moves.
	you can increase/decrease the number of times it runs by changeing the "count" variable with in BlobsDemo class!

Thanks!
